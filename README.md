## 🌌 What is ChaOS?  
ChaOS (**Chaos + Operating System**) is an **Arch-based Linux distribution** built around the **Hyperland compositor**.  
It’s a rebellious take on Linux:  

- **Tiling is first-class** — not an afterthought.  
- **Customisation is yours** — not locked behind someone else’s defaults.  
- **Gaming-ready** — future plans include a curated stack of gaming enhancements (similar to Nobara and Bazzite).  
- **User Friendly** with **Arch power** underneath.  

ChaOS exists because your computer should belong to you — not Microsoft, not Apple, not NVIDIA.
